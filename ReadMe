Issues:

1.  Histogram Function Description

The description for the histogram function in the analysis.py file is inconsistent.
It says that a value Error should be raised if the Image is NOT grayscale, but it
also tells you how to deal with color images (produce three channels for the
histogram return matrix).  I will go with the color handling option because it
is simply better, but you must fix this issue in the source code!

2.  Poor Programming Structure:

In the point_operations.py file why do the functions 'adjust_contrast', 'adjust_brightness',
'adjust_exposure' and 'log_transform' all have different arguments.  This should be
implemented as a Python Class.  Again, as in the first lab I think that more freedom
needs to be given to the students as to how they desire to design their code.  Bear
in mind that also means that the TA(s) need to actually perform LIVE demo(s)!
