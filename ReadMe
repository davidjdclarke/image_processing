Issues:

1.  Histogram function description

The description for the histogram function in the analysis.py file is inconsistent.
It says that a value Error should be raised if the Image is NOT grayscale, but it
also tells you how to deal with color images (produce three channels for the
histogram return matrix).  I will go with the color handling option because it
is simply better, but you must fix this issue in the source code!
